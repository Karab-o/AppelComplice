## üîß Configuration

### Connection Strings

Configure your database connection in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server;Database=LegalCaseManagementDb;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
  }
}
```

### Logging

Adjust logging levels in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore": "Information"
    }
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Using Swagger UI

1. Run the application
2. Navigate to the root URL (Swagger UI is set as default)
3. Explore and test all endpoints interactively

### Sample Data

The application includes seeded data:
- 2 Lawyers (John Smith, Sarah Johnson)
- 2 Courts (Superior Court, District Court)
- 2 Parties (Alice Williams, Bob Davis)

## üîí Validation Rules

- Title: Required, max 200 chars
- Status: Must be one of "Active", "Pending", "Closed", "On Hold"
- Date filed: Cannot be in the future

## üö® Error Handling

The API provides comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid input data or validation errors
- **404 Not Found**: Resource not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side errors

Example error response:
```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "CaseNumber": ["Case number is required"],
    "AssignedLawyerId": ["Valid assigned lawyer ID is required"]
  }
}
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Disabled for better performance control
- **Eager Loading**: Used strategically with `Include()` statements
- **Indexing**: Unique indexes on case numbers, emails, and bar numbers
- **Soft Deletes**: Maintains data integrity while allowing "deletion"
- **Pagination**: Consider implementing for large datasets

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- Authentication and authorization
- Document management
- Email notifications for deadlines
- Calendar integration
- Advanced search and filtering
- Audit trails
- File attachments
- Time tracking
- Billing integration
